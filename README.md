# Bitburner play-through

## About

Bitburner is a cyberpunk themed incremental game which challenges the player to use real-world, JavaScript coding skills to progress.

The game provides a built-in object named **ns** which exposes many functions for retrieving data about the game-state.

My general approach has been to pull this data and give it structure using custom classes. Giving the raw data structure made it easier to understand the game-state, and come up with strategies for game progression.

## Progress

I am currently on the second BitNode that focuses the player on leading a criminal gang.
